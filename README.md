First Android game attempt: "Ball Buster"

Also works on desktop. Not finished of course. 

What works now: 

-"Player" can move left to right. Shoots balls towards other balls. 
-Mouse and touch input works. (Movement of player not available on android yet)

Next step:

-Ball appears before shooting.
-"Rows" of balls need to dissapear when the same color balls are touching each other (Maybe a new component class Rows, working with Map<rowlevel, color>)
-Score system and game over.
-Different levels (like 360 levels and double speed levels etc. with TiledMap for example)
-A simple menu.
